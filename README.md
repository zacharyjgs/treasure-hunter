## How It Works

1. **Image Extraction**: Scrapes all available images from the listing (not just the main image)
2. **Multi-Image Analysis**: Sends up to your specified limit of images to the AI for comprehensive analysis
3. **AI Appraisal**: Uses advanced reasoning models to analyze artistic quality, style, and market value
4. **Real-Time Research**: Built-in web search finds artist information, recent sales, and market data
5. **Comprehensive Output**: Provides detailed analysis including frame construction, signature details, and back markings
6. **Cost Tracking**: Monitors API usage with real-time cost calculation including reasoning tokens

## Important Notes

### Cost Management

- **Real-time tracking**: See costs for each request and session totals
- **Model selection**: Choose appropriate model for your budget (o4-mini is most cost-effective)
- **Image limits**: Use `--max-images` to control costs for listings with many images
- **Reasoning tokens**: Advanced models generate reasoning tokens (included in output token costs)

### Model Pricing (per 1M tokens)

| Model | Input | Output | Cached |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| o4-mini | $1.10 | $4.40 | $0.275 |
| gpt-4o | $2.50 | $10.00 | $1.25 |
| gpt-4o-mini | $0.15 | $0.60 | $0.075 |
| gpt-4.1 | $2.00 | $8.00 | $0.50 |

### Accuracy Disclaimer

- AI appraisals are estimates based on visual analysis combined with web research
- The tool provides comprehensive analysis but cannot verify authenticity
- Actual values depend on provenance, condition, and current market conditions
- Always consult professional appraisers for important decisions
- Use this tool as a sophisticated screening mechanism

### Enhanced Analysis Features

- **Frame Analysis**: Examines frame construction, stretcher bars, and joints for period indicators
- **Back Markings**: Looks for auction house labels, gallery stickers, and exhibition tags
- **Signature Study**: Detailed analysis of signatures, monograms, and artist stamps
- **Multi-Image Context**: Uses all available images for more accurate condition and authenticity assessment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set"**:
   - Set the environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"`
   - Verify the key format (should start with "sk-")

2. **High API costs**:
   - Use `--model gpt-4o-mini` for cheaper analysis
   - Limit images with `--max-images 2`
   - Monitor costs with built-in tracking

3. **Model errors**:
   - Verify your API key has access to the specified model
   - Try a different model if one is unavailable
   - Check OpenAI service status

## Example Use Cases

- **Art Collectors**: Comprehensive analysis before bidding with multiple image examination
- **Dealers**: Professional-level screening with detailed condition and authenticity notes
- **Researchers**: Market analysis with cost tracking for budget management
- **Appraisers**: AI-assisted evaluation with detailed technical analysis

## Recent Improvements

- **Multi-image analysis**: Now uses all available images instead of just the main image
- **Advanced models**: Support for latest OpenAI reasoning models (o3, o4-mini)
- **Cost tracking**: Real-time API usage and cost monitoring
- **Enhanced analysis**: Frame construction, back markings, and signature analysis
- **Better output**: Structured display with comprehensive details
- **Flexible processing**: Single URL or batch processing modes
